# NLP Analysis of Xenophobic Twitter Comments During COVID Outbreak

## Summary



## Introduction

Even though COVID-19 has been recognized by many people as past tense, the pandemic has had a profound impact on societies worldwide, affecting every aspect of daily life. Unfortunately, the pandemic has also led to an increase in xenophobic attitudes towards certain groups, particularly Asian and Chinese. Data show that anti-Asian hate crimes increased by 339 percent nationwide from 2020 to 2021 in the United States. In fact, historically, every large-scale outbreak of a pandemic was accompanied by hatred towards a certain ethnic group and the associated violence. 

Social media platforms like Twitter have become a forum for people to express their opinions and emotions about the pandemic and its consequences. In this context, there is a need to understand the nature and extent of xenophobic speech on Twitter during the pandemic. 

Natural language processing (NLP) is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze large volumes of text data and extract meaningful insights from it. In this study, I aim to use NLP techniques to analyze xenophobic Twitter comments during the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, I explored the sentiments and themes expressed in these comments, as well as the linguistic characteristics of xenophobic language on Twitter. The findings could help shed light on the prevalence and nature of xenophobia during the pandemic. Understanding why people generate those xenophobic statements and why rumors always spread faster than scientific knowledge can help us better perceive the world and prevent tragedies from happening again.
